# Bulk-Upload-Macros-on-Cisco-video-devices

Pyhton based Script developed using netmiko module which helps to upload macros and Extensions on CE video devices.
Netmiko module is used to SSH in device and fire API command, script then will read extension and Macro code from text files.
Save your UI Extensions in extnesion.txt file.
Save  Macro in JavaScript.txt, it doesnt needs to be JS file, you can paste code in plain text file and name it as JavaScript.txt
You can use sample extension.txt and JavaScript text from repository.
